#### Steps to use the visualization:
1. Unpack "network_json/networkJSON.zip"
2. Open "graphs.html" in your browser. (If your browser is too old you have to host it on a local web server)

#### Line chart controls:
o) Mousewheel: zoom  
o) Doubleclick: hold current value   
o) Cursor position: show anonymity bounds and network bubble for current date   

#### Network Bubble color coding:
Green: Guard relays  
Blue: Middle relays  
Orange: Exit relays   

When moving the cursor over a relay a pop-up shows its /16 subnet group and its bandwidth. Other nodes in this subnet also get highlighted.
